  Abstract                 = {Arrays of atoms can be a useful resource for quantum information. However, loading atoms into arrays is typically a stochastic process, which leads to imperfections. Two groups have now performed defect-free assembly of atoms into arrays (see the Perspective by Regal). The researchers first loaded the atoms stochastically and imaged the system. They then shuttled the atoms around to form perfect arrays. Barredo et al. worked with two-dimensional arrays, creating a variety of spatial configurations. Endres et al. manipulated atoms along a line. By further cooling down the atoms and generating interactions among them, the techniques may also find use in quantum simulation.Science, this issue p. 972, p. 1021; see also p. 1024Large arrays of individually controlled atoms trapped in optical tweezers are a very promising platform for quantum engineering applications. However, deterministic loading of the traps is experimentally challenging. We demonstrate the preparation of fully loaded two-dimensional arrays of up to ~50 microtraps, each containing a single atom and arranged in arbitrary geometries. Starting from initially larger, half-filled matrices of randomly loaded traps, we obtain user-defined target arrays at unit filling. This is achieved with a real-time control system and a moving optical tweezers, which together enable a sequence of rapid atom moves depending on the initial distribution of the atoms in the arrays. These results open exciting prospects for quantum engineering with neutral atoms in tunable two-dimensional geometries.},

  Abstract                 = {In quantum entanglement, correlations between particles mean that the measurement of one determines the outcome of the other(s). Generally, when trying to exploit quantum entanglement, the larger the number of entangled particles, the better. However, the size of entangled systems has been limited. Haas et al. (p. 180, published online 27 March; see the Perspective by Widera) prepared a small ensemble of ultracold atoms into a collective entangled state. Starting from one internal quantum state, the system of cold atoms was excited with a weak microwave pulse leading to a small excitation probability. Because it is not known which atom is promoted into the excited state, the detection of one quantum of excitation projects the system into an entangled quantum state, called a W-state. A fast repeat-until-success scheme produced such W-states quasi-deterministically. Using such a technique was able to yield entangled states of more than 40 particles. The relatively large ensemble-entangled states could potentially in the future find use in quantum sensing or enhanced quantum metrology applications. Multiparticle entanglement enables quantum simulations, quantum computing, and quantum-enhanced metrology. Yet, there are few methods to produce and measure such entanglement while maintaining single-qubit resolution as the number of qubits is scaled up. Using atom chips and fiber-optical cavities, we have developed a method based on nondestructive collective measurement and conditional evolution to create symmetric entangled states and perform their tomography. We demonstrate creation and analysis of entangled states with mean atom numbers up to 41 and experimentally prove multiparticle entanglement. Our method is independent of atom number and should allow generalization to other entangled states and other physical implementations, including circuit quantum electrodynamics.},
